# Important to know
This is a v1 of the pack that is very limited the logic expects you to have all stages from the start (will fix this but it will take a while) and doesn't account for the monkeys in the secret room to require Super Monkey Morph.
Also this uses hard logic so if you don't know how to access something look at the spread sheet:

## What is this
This is an Ape Escape 3 poptracker Pack it is very limited
there is plans to improve this to some extent but don't expect much out of me
I barely know what I am doing here
## Todo list
Add camera sanity

Add settings

Track the amount of channel keys you have

Make the tracker know if you have the stage or not

Put logic for the secret rooms to require Super Monkey Morph

Add more maps

Clean the code (probably won't do this because GOD THIS THING IS A MESS)
