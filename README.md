# Important to know
Has some logic problems like Super Monkey Morph not being required for secret room monkeys.
Also this uses hard logic so if you don't know how to access something look at the spread sheet:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X9sZx18RyGr5vdZAenyaztxwBWmzszhxCujjln8gl9o/edit?usp=sharing
but if the spread sheet doesn't say anything about something then that is a logic problem I don't have much time to fix this so do expect a lot of problems

You can  also find the randomizer for this game here:

## What is this
This is an Ape Escape 3 poptracker Pack it is very limited
there is plans to improve this to some extent but don't expect much out of me
I barely know what I am doing here
## Todo list

Add more settings

Put logic for the secret rooms to require Super Monkey Morph

Add more maps

Clean the code (probably won't do this because GOD THIS THING IS A MESS)
